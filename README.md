### Bukkit Dev: http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/nexgen-koths/

### Building:
NexGen KoTHs uses Apache Ant (https://ant.apache.org/) as it's builder. The following command should build the project:
`$ ant jar`

### Continuos Integration Server (Development Builds):
If you don't want to compile the source yourself, or are just too lazy, you can download nightly builds [here](http://ci.mrlolethan.com/job/NexGen_KoTHs/).
